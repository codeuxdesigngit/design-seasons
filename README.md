# DesignSeasons
DesignSeasons is a tool that helps UX designers create aesthetically harmonious color palettes based on the 12 Seasonal Color Types. Each palette contains a curated selection of up to 300 colors that are carefully chosen to work together in harmony, making it easier for designers to create visually cohesive products.

UX designers can select one of the 12 seasonal color palettes to work with throughout the design process. Once a palette is chosen, designers can seamlessly work within that single, curated set of colors to ensure consistency and harmony across all their design elements, from websites to apps.



In addition to the color palette selector, users can also upload photos for two distinct features: 

Photo Analyzer: Upload a photo, and DesignSeasons will analyze it to determine which seasonal palette it matches.

Photo Filters: Apply filters to any uploaded photo, transforming it to match your selected seasonal palette, similar to Instagram-style photo effects.

DesignSeasons simplifies the design process by offering a comprehensive, harmonious set of colors for every project, enabling UX designers to easily create aesthetically consistent designs.
